\item Neural trajectories in the hippocampus exhibited greater variability during a working memory (WM) task compared to those in the entorhinal cortex and amygdala regions.

\item The distance of neural trajectories between encoding and retrieval states in the hippocampus was memory-load dependent during a WM task.


\item Hippocampal neural trajectories fluctuated between the encoding and retrieval states in a task-dependent manner during both baseline and sharp-wave ripple (SWR) periods.

\item Hippocampal neural trajectories shifted from encoding to retrieval states during SWR period.
