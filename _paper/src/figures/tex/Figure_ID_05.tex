\smallskip
\\
\textbf{\textit{A.}} The distance from origin ($O$) of the peri-sharp-wave-ripple neural trajectory (mean \textpm 95\% confidence interval). The intervals may be obscured due to their minimal ranges. \textbf{\textit{B.}} The distance from the origin ($O$) during the pre-, mid-, and post-SWR periods is demonstrated (*\textit{p} $<$ 0.05, **\textit{p} $<$ 0.01, ***\textit{p} $<$ 0.001; Brunner--Munzel test applied). Abbreviations: SWR, sharp-wave ripple events; eSWR, SWR during the encoding phase; rSWR, SWR within the retrieval phase; SWR$^+$, positive SWR event; SWR$^-$, control events for SWR$^+$; pre-, mid-, or post-SWR refer to the time intervals from $-800$ to $-250$ ms, from $-250$ to $+250$ ms, or from $+250$ to $+800$ ms, respectively, all relative to the SWR center.}
