\subsection{iEEG Recording and NT in MTL Regions during the Sternberg Task}
Our analysis employed a publicly accessible dataset \cite{boran_dataset_2020}, which comprises LFP signals (Figure~\ref{fig:01}A) from MTL regions (Table~\ref{tab:01}) recorded during the execution of the modified Sternberg task. We extracted SWR$^+$ candidates from LFP signals that were filtered in the 80--140 Hz ripple band (Figure~\ref{fig:01}B), originating in all hippocampal regions (refer to Methods section). Meanwhile, SWR$^-$ candidates, control events for SWR$^+$ candidates, were defined at the same timestamps but distributed across different trials (Figure~\ref{fig:01}). The dataset encompassed multi-unit spikes (Figure~\ref{fig:01}C), recognized via a spike sorting algorithm \cite{niediek_reliable_2016}. Employing GPFA \cite{yu_gaussian-process_2009}, we applied this to 50-ms windows of binned multi-unit activity without overlaps to determine the NTs, or factors, of MTL regions by session and region (Figure~\ref{fig:01}D). We normalized each factor per session and region, for instance, session \#2 in AHL of subject \#1. We then calculated the Euclidean distance from the origin ($O$) (Figure~\ref{fig:01}E).

\subsection{Correlation of Hippocampal NT with the Sternberg Task}
Figure~\ref{fig:02}A exhibits a distribution of median NTs, comprising 50 trials, within the three main factor spaces. Utilizing the elbow method, we established the optimal embedding dimension for the GPFA model as three (Figure~\ref{fig:02}B). The NT distance from the origin ($O$) --- represented as $\mathrm{\lVert g_{F} \rVert}$, $\mathrm{\lVert g_{E} \rVert}$, $\mathrm{\lVert g_{M} \rVert}$, and $\mathrm{\lVert g_{R} \rVert}$ --- in the hippocampus surpassed the corresponding distances in the EC and amygdala (Figure~\ref{fig:02}C \& D).\footnote{Hippocampus: Distance = 1.11 [1.01], median [IQR], \textit{n} = 195,681 timepoints; EC: Distance = 0.94 [1.10], median [IQR], \textit{n} = 133,761 timepoints; Amygdala: Distance = 0.78 [0.88], median [IQR], \textit{n} = 165,281 timepoints.}
\\

Similarly, we computed the distances between the geometric medians of four phases, namely $\mathrm{\lVert g_{F}g_{E} \rVert}$, $\mathrm{\lVert g_{F}g_{M} \rVert}$, $\mathrm{\lVert g_{F}g_{R} \rVert}$, $\mathrm{\lVert g_{E}g_{M} \rVert}$, $\mathrm{\lVert g_{E}g_{R} \rVert}$, and $\mathrm{\lVert g_{M}g_{R} \rVert}$. The hippocampus showed larger distances between phases than those in the EC and amygdala. \footnote{Hippocampus: Distance = 0.60 [0.70], median [IQR], \textit{n} = 8,772 combinations; EC: Distance = 0.28 [0.52], median [IQR], \textit{n} = 5,017 combinations (\textit{p} $<$ 0.01; Brunner--Munzel test); Amygdala: Distance = 0.24 [0.42], median [IQR], \textit{n} = 7,466 combinations (\textit{p} $<$ 0.01; Brunner--Munzel test).}

\subsection{Memory-Load-Dependent NT Distance between Encoding and Retrieval States in the Hippocampus}
Regarding memory load in the Sternberg task, we observed a negative correlation between the correct rate of trials and the set size, which denotes the number of letters to be encoded (Figure~\ref{fig:03}A).\footnote{Correct rate: set size four (0.99 \textpm 0.11, mean \textpm SD; \textit{n} = 333 trials) vs. set size six (0.93 \textpm 0.26; \textit{n} = 278 trials; \textit{p} $<$ 0.001, Brunner--Munzel test with Bonferroni correction) and set size eight (0.87 \textpm 0.34; \textit{n} = 275 trials; \textit{p} $<$ 0.05; Brunner--Munzel test with Bonferroni correction). Generally, \textit{p} $<$ 0.001 for Kruskal--Wallis test; correlation coefficient = - 0.20, \textit{p} $<$ 0.001.} Concomitantly, a positive correlation was noted between the response time and set size (Figure~\ref{fig:03}B).\footnote{Response time: set size four (1.26 \textpm 0.45 s; \textit{n} = 333 trials) vs. set size six (1.53 \textpm 0.91 s; \textit{n} = 278 trials) and set size eight (1.66 \textpm 0.80 s; \textit{n} = 275 trials). All comparisons \textit{p} $<$ 0.001, Brunner--Munzel test with Bonferroni correction; \textit{p} $<$ 0.001 for Kruskal--Wallis test; correlation coefficient = 0.22, \textit{p} $<$ 0.001}.
\\
\indent
Next, we discovered a positive correlation between set size and the NT distance separating the encoding and retrieval phases ($\mathrm{log_{10}\lVert g_{E}g_{R} \rVert}$) (Figure~\ref{fig:03}C).\footnote{Correlation between set size and $\mathrm{log_{10}(\lVert g_{E}g_{R} \rVert}$): correlation coefficient = 0.05, \textit{p} $<$ 0.001. Specific values: $\mathrm{\lVert g_{E}g_{R} \rVert}$ = 0.54 [0.70] for set size four, \textit{n} = 447; $\mathrm{\lVert g_{E}g_{R} \rVert}$ = 0.58 [0.66] for set size six, \textit{n} = 381; $\mathrm{\lVert g_{E}g_{R} \rVert}$ = 0.61 [0.63] for set size eight, \textit{n} = 395.}. However, distances between other phase combinations did not highlight statistically significant correlations (Figures~\ref{fig:03}D and \ref{fig:s02}).

\subsection{Detection of Hippocampal SWRs from Putative CA1 Regions}
To enhance the precision of recording sites and SWR detection, we approximated the electrode placements in the CA1 regions of the hippocampus using distinguished multi-unit spike patterns during SWR events. SWR$^+$/SWR$^-$ candidates from each session and hippocampal region were embedded in two-dimensional space using UMAP (Figure~\ref{fig:04}A).\footnote{Consider the AHL in session \#1 of subject \#1 as a case in point.} With the silhouette score as a quality metric for clustering (Figure~\ref{fig:04}B and Table~\ref{tab:02}), recording sites demonstrating an average silhouette score exceeding 0.6 across all sessions were identified as putative CA1 regions.\footnote{The identified regions were the AHL of subject \#1, AHR of subject \#3, PHL of subject \#4, AHL of subject \#6, and AHR of subject \#9.} (Tables~\ref{tab:02} and \ref{tab:03}). We identified five putative CA1 regions, four of which were not indicated as seizure onset zones (Table~\ref{tab:01}).
\\
\indent
Subsequently, SWR$^+$/SWR$^-$ candidates within these putative CA1 regions were labeled as SWR$^+$ and SWR$^-$, respectively\footnote{These definitions produced equal counts for both categories: SWR$^+$ (\textit{n} = 1,170) and SWR$^-$ (\textit{n} = 1,170).} (Table~\ref{tab:03}). Both SWR$^+$ and SWR$^-$ manifested identical durations \footnote{These definitions result in equal durations for both categories: SWR$^+$ (93.0 [65.4] ms) and SWR$^-$ (93.0 [65.4] ms).} due to their definitions and followed a log-normal distribution (Figure~\ref{fig:04}C). During the initial 400 ms of the retrieval phase, an increase in SWR$^+$ incidence was found\footnote{SWR$^+$ increased against the bootstrap sample; 95th percentile = 0.42 [Hz]; \textit{p} $<$ 0.05.} (Figure~\ref{fig:04}D). The peak ripple band amplitude of SWR$^+$ surpassed that of SWR$^-$ and followed a log-normal distribution (Figure~\ref{fig:04}E).\footnote{SWR$^+$ (3.05 [0.85] SD of baseline, median [IQR]; \textit{n} = 1,170) vs. SWR$^-$ (2.37 [0.33] SD of baseline, median [IQR]; \textit{n} = 1,170; \textit{p} $<$ 0.001; Brunner--Munzel test).}.

\subsection{Transient Change in Hippocampal NT during SWR}
We assessed the 'distance' of the NT from the origin ($O$) during SWR events in both encoding and retrieval phases (Figure~\ref{fig:05}A). Observing the increase in distance during SWR, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:05}A, we categorized each SWR into three stages: pre-, mid-, and post-SWR. Hence, the distances from the origin $O$ during those SWR intervals are identified as $\mathrm{\lVert \text{pre-eSWR}^+ \rVert}$, $\mathrm{\lVert \text{mid-eSWR}^+ \rVert}$ and others.
\\
\indent
As a result, $\mathrm{\lVert \text{mid-eSWR}^+ \rVert}$\footnote{1.25 [1.30], median [IQR], \textit{n} = 1,281 in Match IN task; 1.12 [1.35], median [IQR], \textit{n} = 1,163 in Mismatch OUT task} exceeded $\mathrm{\lVert \text{pre-eSWR}^+ \rVert}$\footnote{1.08 [1.07], median [IQR], \textit{n} = 1,149 in Match IN task; 0.90 [1.12], median [IQR], \textit{n} = 1,088 in Mismatch OUT task}, and $\mathrm{\lVert \text{mid-rSWR}^+ \rVert}$\footnote{1.32 [1.24], median [IQR], \textit{n} = 935 in Match IN task; 1.15 [1.26], median [IQR], \textit{n} = 891 in Mismatch OUT task} was larger than $\mathrm{\lVert \text{pre-rSWR}^+ \rVert}$ in both the Match IN and Mismatch OUT tasks.\footnote{1.19 [0.96], median [IQR], \textit{n} = 673 in Match IN task; 0.94 [0.88], median [IQR], \textit{n} = 664 in Mismatch OUT task}.

\subsection{Visualization of Hippocampal NT during SWR in Two-Dimensional Spaces}
Having observed NT 'jumping' during SWR (Figure~\ref{fig:05}), we visualized the three-dimensional NTs of pre-, mid-, and post-SWR events during the encoding and retrieval phases (Figure~\ref{fig:06}). The distance between these was found to be memory-load dependent (Figure~\ref{fig:03}). 
\\
\indent
To provide two-dimensional visualization, we linearly aligned peri-SWR NTs by setting $\mathrm{g_{E}}$ at the origin (0, 0) and $\mathrm{g_{R}}$ at ($\mathrm{\lVert g_{E}g_{R} \rVert}$, 0). Subsequently, we rotated these aligned NTs around the $\mathrm{g_{E}g_{R}}$ axis (the x axis), ensuring that the distances from the origin $O$ in the original three-dimensional spaces and angles from $\overrightarrow{\mathrm{g_{E}g_{R}}}$ are retained in the two-dimensional equivalent.
\\
\indent
Scatter plot visualization of NTs within these two-dimensional spaces revealed distinct distributions of peri-SWR NTs based on phases and task types. A notable example of this is the observation that the magnitude of  $\mathrm{\lVert \text{mid-eSWR}^+ \rVert}$ exceeds that of $\mathrm{\lVert \text{pre-eSWR}^+ \rVert}$ (Figure~\ref{fig:06}B), which is consistent with our previous observations (Figure~\ref{fig:05}).

\subsection{Fluctuations of Hippocampal NTs between Encoding and Retrieval States}
Subsequently, we investigated the 'direction' of the NT in relation to $\overrightarrow{\mathrm{g_{E}g_{R}}}$, which was found to be dependent on memory load (Figure~\ref{fig:03}). The directions of the SWRs were determined by the NT at $-250$ ms and $+250$ ms from their center, denoted as, for example, $\overrightarrow{\mathrm{eSWR^+}}$. We calculated the cosine similarities between $\overrightarrow{\mathrm{g_{E}g_{R}}}$, $\overrightarrow{\mathrm{eSWR}}$, and $\overrightarrow{\mathrm{rSWR}}$ in both SWR (SWR$^+$) and baseline periods (SWR$^-$) (Figure~\ref{fig:07}A--D).
\\
\indent
$\overrightarrow{\mathrm{rSWR^-}} \cdot \overrightarrow{\mathrm{g_{E}g_{R}}}$ exhibited a biphasic distribution. By computing the difference between the distribution of $\overrightarrow{\mathrm{rSWR^+}} \cdot \overrightarrow{\mathrm{g_{E}g_{R}}}$ (Figure~\ref{fig:07}A \& B) and that of $\overrightarrow{\mathrm{rSWR^-}} \cdot \overrightarrow{\mathrm{g_{E}g_{R}}}$ (Figure~\ref{fig:07}C \& D), we were able to determine the contributions of SWR (Figure~\ref{fig:07}E \& F), which indicated a shift in the direction of $\overrightarrow{\mathrm{g_{E}g_{R}}}$ (Figure~\ref{fig:07}E \& F: \textit{red rectangles}). 
\\
\indent
Furthermore, $\overrightarrow{\mathrm{eSWR^+}} \cdot \overrightarrow{\mathrm{rSWR^+}}$ was less than $\overrightarrow{\mathrm{eSWR^-}} \cdot \overrightarrow{\mathrm{rSWR^-}}$ strictly in Mismatch OUT task (Figure~\ref{fig:07}F: \textit{pink circles}). In other words, eSWR and rSWR pointed in the opposite direction exclusively in Mismatch OUT task but not Match IN task (Figure~\ref{fig:07}E: \textit{pink circles}).
