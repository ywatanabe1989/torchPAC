%% \usepackage{xr}
%% \externaldocument{chapterI}
%% And then can use \sref{a} like normal. You can also add a prefix:

%% \externaldocument[I-]{chapterI}
%% Then, you can reference it as \sref{I-a} which is useful if you have identical label names in different chapters.

%% Note that the normal xr doesn't add hyperlinks. It only adds the label text. The zref package can be used for this. It provides the zref-xr subpackage which gives you the same functionality and should work fine with hyperref (after all both packages are from the same author). You only need to replace \externaldocument with \zexternaldocument and \sref with \zref.

%% Note that the xr package reads the aux file, e.g. in this case, it checks chapterI.aux for references.
